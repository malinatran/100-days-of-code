# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 03, 2016

**Today's Progress:** Created a program to find all anagrams of a word.

**Thoughts:** This was fun! I learned new things, like that a `word` file exists on my (everyone's) computer and how to use the terminal to find a document (`find / -name "word"`). Struggled with figuring out best way to sort through file and type of data structure to store words of the same anagram.
