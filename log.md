# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 03, 2016

**Today's Progress:** Created a program to find all anagrams of a word.

**Thoughts:** This was fun! I learned new things, like that a `word` file exists on my (everyone's) computer and how to use the terminal to find a document (`find / -name "word"`). Struggled with figuring out best way to sort through file and type of data structure to store words of the same anagram.

### Day 1: January 04, 2016

**Today's Progress:** Worked on a few code challenges from FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Although the challenges were progressively more difficult, I found it easier once I was in a certain frame of mind. My default is to create an array, iterate through args, and push to that array (lol). Learned that you can create RegExp objects in JavaScript and `.match` will return either an array or `null`, but you can wrap it around a `Boolean` object to get a boolean. I chose to refactor the Confirm Ending exercise because I knew the code was satisfying the existing tests but wasn't living up to the spirit and purpose of the challenge. Got to do some more regexin'.

### Day 2: January 05, 2016

**Today's Progress:** Worked on my hosted tic-tac-toe game.

**Thoughts:** I really wanted to probe and see if I can make my game playable for two players. And guess what? I could! I set up another endpoint for two players and abstracted logic related to the game state. Users can click on the "2 Players" button and an Ajax request will hit the endpoint. It's less involved on the server side since the only logic my server will check for is whether the game has ended and if so, whether there is a winner. In terms of the UI, I'm storing the current player's marker and switching between the two.

### Day 3: January 06, 2016

**Today's Progress:** Worked on my hosted tic-tac-toe game.

**Thoughts:** I wanted to refactor my code and streamline the server's responsibility. What this means is that I wanted to hit the same endpoint (`/make_move`) no mattter if it's a single-player or two-player game. It was not too complex, but I was thrown off by one UI issue (the message board not being updated) and realizing that I needed to change the value passed to the server into a boolean, as opposed to "true" or "false" (string values).

### Day 4: January 07, 2016

**Today's Progress:** Worked on my hosted tic-tac-toe game.

**Thoughts:** Didn't make much headway, except I migrated tests and added more test coverage to the `/make_move` endpoint. Explored an issue that I was having with receiving and responding to requests for the favicon. Still confused. ðŸ¤”

### Day 5: January 08, 2016

**Today's Progress:** Worked on my hosted tic-tac-toe game.

**Thoughts:** More test coverage! Fixed a bug that occurred when playing a two-player game followed by plyaing a one-player game (the human player's marker was then X, not O). Spent only 40 min coding, but I think it's fair since I've been coding for 2 hrs+ on the other days.

### Day 6: January 09, 2016

**Today's Progress:** Worked on a few code challenges from FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** I got about a decent half-hour in after attending an evening event, but for the sake of sleep, I'm wrapping it up.

**Link:** [Repeat string num times](https://gist.github.com/malinatran/5af72e5eb3ac2bca2a08f440188b7b25) and [truncate string](https://gist.github.com/malinatran/474753ee5f241938d955013f16463674)

### Day 7: January 10, 2016

**Today's Progress:** Debugged hosted tic-tac-toe game.

**Thoughts:** I was having major issues and after hours of exploring the source of these issues, realized that it was due to how I was storing a global variable. Another issue was a result of not properly translating a value of `nil` into a string. Sending a `nil` vlaue ends up just being blank. So many lessons learned, many hours later.

### Day 8: January 11, 2016

**Today's Progress:** Debugged hosted tic-tac-toe game.

**Thoughts:** Fixed issue with shared state.

### Day 9: January 13, 2016

**Today's Progress:** Git && looking into Selenium webdriver.

**Thoughts:** Tried to fix an old git message and wasn't able to rebase it without having merge conflics. This sent me a wild goose chase, and I still haven't been able to resolve. 

**Link:** None!
